### MIni-Exercise: A Brief History of Google's Home Page

Has a particular webpage always appeared the way it does now? How would you know? Webpages have a history, but that history can feel awfully elusive. There are some tools ––for instance, there's a bot that tweets out any time a headline changes on NYTimes homepage: https://twitter.com/nyt_diff But that's just one publication (and a bot, not a systematic record). 

What if we wanted to look at a more systematic history of past web pages?

As we learned in Jill Lepore's "The Cobweb" (2016), there's an organization devoted to archiving the web: The Internet Archive. The Internet Archives a nonprofit devoted to archiving "born-digital" content––that is, text files, images, audio recordings that are created digitally. They have a massive archive of images, books, audio files, video, and pieces of code. They also have a whole separate archive of webpages. This tool is called The WayBackMachine, and it's designed to archive webpages. (If you want to know a bit more about how the organization defines a "web page", what files get captured, where this data is stored, and how, read [this blog post](https://blog.archive.org/2016/10/23/defining-web-pages-web-sites-and-web-captures/) and [this FAQ page](https://help.archive.org/help/using-the-wayback-machine/)


To get a sense of how the WayBackMachine works, we're going to do a quick exercise exploring the history of Google's homepage.

1. Navigate to https://web.archive.org/
2. In the URL entry box, type in "www.google.com", then press ENTER
3. You should see a calendar with a series of dates. Click on one of the black bars. You should see a calendar of 12 months with multicolored circles. Click on one of the circles on one of the dates, and clid on URLS linked timestamped snapshot of the webpage at that moment in time. A new webpage should pop up. How much (or little) has ben preserved of this past version of the website?
5. Choose 2 or three different points in time to look at the snapshots of Google's homepage. What observations might you make about the changes in this ubiquitous search engine? 
6. What other questions could the WayBackMachine be used to answer? What might be the limitations of the WayBackMachine as a tool for historical research?
